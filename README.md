The repository for our Programming Project 

## Deepracer is a cloud-based web application that provides a comprehensive, high-resolution interface for Deepracer training and events. This unified interface offers a combination of high-resolution views and training diagnostics, all designed to exploit the capabilities of the Global Operations Visualization (GOV) Lab's 40-megapixel tiled display wall at RMIT City Campus.

The project will use JavaScript with react for the frontend.
The group consists of:
